# TensorNetwork for Machine Learning

TensorNetwork for Machine Learning [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06329) is a technique created by Alphabet (Google) X and Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Quantenoptik to classify images such as MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using tensor networks.

This is an unofficial implementation using PyTorch. Initialization of the tensor network is based on the reference implementation.

## Reference implementation

- [MPS_classifier](https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork/tree/0.1.0/experiments/MPS_classifier) using TensorFlow
